## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ritesh

A **Graduate Research Assistant** in the physics department at the [University of Rhode Island](https://web.uri.edu/physics/), actively engaged with gravity research group [U2GRC](https://web.uri.edu/gravity/).

I'm currently developing surrogate models of gravitational waves emitted bianry black holes (BBH). My research also extends to analyzing the effect of uncertainty in waveform modeling, and I am deeply involded in studying the phenomenology of two merging black holes.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit](http://bhptoolkit.org)
- :pushpin: I received M.Sc. in physics from IIT, Bombay
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning about black hole perturbation theory and HPC clusters
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about phyics, black holes, universe etc
